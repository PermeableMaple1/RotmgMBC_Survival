I made a practice tool for the survival phase of the MBC fight. Tried to make it as close as possible to the real thing. I will be adding debuffs in v2.0. Stats such as speed, defence, vit, and health are adjustable, as well as turning towers on or off.

## Controls:
Movement: [WASD]  
Rotate Screen: [QE]  
Reset: [R]  
Menu: [M]
